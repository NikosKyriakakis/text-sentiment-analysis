# Text Sentiment Analysis
Introductory project to NLP and deep learning

## Objectives
The main objectives of this project were the following:
* Use different text representations
* Build, train and evaluate different neural networks on 2 different datasets (IMDB movie reviews, Twitter product reviews)
* Use a model which was trained on one of the above datasets and evaluate it's performance on the other dataset, thus we would get an idea of the generalisation ability of the model at hand

## Prerequisities
* The datasets which are required in the context of this project can be found in the next URL: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1APqbF4OFCiuyPuIf_iQ-icC5MRuQlkU-?usp=sharing and to use them simply create a directory named **data** in the root directory of this project and place them inside.
* Since pretrained embeddings have been used (fasttext), the .vec file containing them can be found in the following URL: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1APqbF4OFCiuyPuIf_iQ-icC5MRuQlkU-?usp=sharing
* Once the .vec file has been downloaded, simply move it to the **data** directory of this project

## Notes
* Python version used:  3.8.10
* Along with all project files we have included a requirements.txt for easier dependency management
